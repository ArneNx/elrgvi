# elrgvi
Implementation of algorithms from the paper "Efficient Low Rank Gaussian Variational Inferencefor Neural Networks"

Since the official repo remains empty, I decided to share my implementation of ELRGVI here. 
Please note that this is extracted from another project and is therefore not runnable as-is. 
It should give a good idea of how things are implemented though.
